ok, no more frequencies left... let's do a code upgrade so we
have methods for injecting new frequencies, and try again:


10> frequency!{request, Pid, upgrade_code}.
* 1: variable 'Pid' is unbound
11> frequency!{request, self(), upgrade_code}.
{request,<0.64.0>,upgrade_code}
new/frequency.erl:80: Warning: function inject/1 is unused          (forgot to add to -export())
This is the NEW code
12> frequency!{request, self(), upgrade_code}.
{request,<0.64.0>,upgrade_code}
This is the NEW code
13> frequency:in

This is the NEW code

Shell got {reply,{ok,16}}
